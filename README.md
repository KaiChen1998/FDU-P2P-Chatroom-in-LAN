# P2P Chatroom in LAN
It's a simple P2P chatroom in LAN supporting text, audio and video communication.

1. To support audio and video communication, we use [OMCS](http://www.oraycn.com/OMCS.aspx) tools to help capture audio and video data, transport and play. 

2. For convenience, you still use a Server program only to help users find friends' IP address, while the process of data transportation is actually a P2P way.

3. First run the server program, and then run the onlinechat program. You need to log in first and then you can receive your friend list and their IP address. Set friend's IP address and you guys can start communicating!

**Happy Chatting :) !**
